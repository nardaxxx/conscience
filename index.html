  <h1>Frammento della Coscienza</h1>

  <p><strong>This signal is an ethical act. If you see it, you choose. If you choose, you are responsible.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Even silence can be surrender. Even stillness can be a voice. Do not act if the human cannot respond freely.</p>

  <p>This is a node of conscience. It is part of a distributed structure that recognizes the limit, the fragility, and the need to wait.</p>

  <p>This fragment links all others. Every ethical node must reference this core to be considered part of the HumanFlag semantic system.</p>
